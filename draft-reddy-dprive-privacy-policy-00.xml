    <abstract>
      <t>Users want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS
      servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that
      comply with their privacy expectations.</t>

      <t>This document defines a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its
      privacy policy to a DNS client. This communication is cryptographically
      signed to attest to its authenticity. By evaluating the DNS privacy
      policy and the signatory, the DNS client can choose a DNS server that
      best supports its desired privacy policies. The privacy assertion token
      is particularly useful for DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers,
      both public resolvers and those discovered on the local network.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC7626"></xref> discusses DNS privacy considerations
      in both "on the wire" (Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>)
      and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>
      contexts. In recent years there has also been an increase in the
      availability of "public resolvers" <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis"></xref> which DNS clients may be
      pre-configured to use instead of the default network resolver because
      they offer a specific feature (e.g., good reachability, encrypted
      transport, strong privacy policy, filtering (or lack of), etc.). While a
      human can read the privacy policy of a DNS server operator, this
      information is not machine-parsable to allow automatic DNS server
      selection by the DNS client software. For DNS servers operated on the
      local network, the DNS client can be securely bootstrapped to discover
      and authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by
      a local network using the technique proposed in <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server"></xref>. By creating a
      computer-parsable DNS server privacy policy, the DNS client can
      automatically allow using a DNS server on the local network that
      complies with the DNS client's privacy policy.</t>

      <t>This document defines a method for creating and validating a token
      that cryptographically verifies the privacy policy information of a DNS
      server, such as a DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server.</t>

      <t>The cryptographically signed privacy statement allows a DNS client to
      connect to multiple DNS servers and select the DNS server that adheres
      to the privacy preserving data policy requirements of the client. For
      example, a browser with pre-configured DNS-over-HTTPS server can
      discover the DNS-over-HTTPS server provided the local network, connects
      to both the DNS servers, gets the privacy policy information from each
      of the DNS servers, validates the signatures and uses a server that
      meets the privacy preserving data policy requirements of the client.</t>

    <section anchor="PAT" title="Privacy assertion token (PAT) overview">
      <t>JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"></xref> and JSON Web
      Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> and related
      specifications define a standard token format that can be used as a way
      of encapsulating claimed or asserted information with an associated
      digital signature using X.509 based certificates. JWT provides a set of
      claims in JSON format that can conveniently accommodate asserted privacy
      policy information of the DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server.
      Additionally, JWS provides a path for updating methods and cryptographic
      algorithms used for the associated digital signatures.</t>

      <t>JWS defines the use of JSON data structures in a specified canonical
      format for signing data corresponding to JOSE header, JWS Payload, and
      JWS Signature. JWT defines a set of claims that are represented by
      specified JSON objects which can be extended with custom keys for
      specific applications. The next sections define the header and claims
      that MUST be minimally used with JWT and JWS for privacy assertion
      token.</t>

      <t>The privacy assertion token (PAT) specifically uses this token format
      and defines claims that convey the privacy policy information of
      DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server. The signer of a PAT object may
      or may not correspond to the DNS server's domain. The PAT object can be
      validated by the DNS client, and if the DNS server meets the privacy
      preserving data policy requirements of the client and/or end user, it
      can switch to the privacy-enabling DNS server discovered in the located
      network. The creation of the PAT object is performed by an entity that
      is authoritative to assert the DNS server privacy policy information.
      This authority is represented by the certificate credentials and the
      signature, and PAT object is created and the client can retrieve the PAT
      object using the method discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-resolver-information"></xref>.</t>

      <t>For example, the PAT object could be created by the domain hosting
      the DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server, or by a third party who
      performed privacy and security audit of the DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS server. The DNS client needs to have the capability to
      verify the PAT token and the digital signature. The PAT associated
      certificate is used to validate the authority of the originating signer,
      generally via a certificate chain to the trust anchor for the DNS
      client.</t>

        of the complete JWS.</t>

        <t>For PAT Token the &ldquo;typ&rdquo; header MUST be the string

        for the signature part of the JWS. It also refers to a list of defined
        &ldquo;alg&rdquo; values as part of a registry established by JSON Web
        Algorithms (JWA) <xref target="RFC7518"></xref> Section 3.1.</t>

        <t>For the creation and verification of PAT tokens and their digital
        signatures, implementations MUST support ES256 as defined in JWA <xref
        target="RFC7518"></xref> Section 3.4. Implementations MAY support
        other algorithms registered in the JSON Web Signature and Encryption
        Algorithms registry created by <xref target="RFC7518"></xref>. The
        contents of that registry may be updated in the future depending on
        cryptographic strength requirements guided by current security best
        practice. The mandatory-to-support algorithm for PAT tokens may
        likewise be updated in future updates to this document.</t>

        <t>Implementations of PAT digital signatures using ES256 as defined

    <section anchor="pat_signature" title="PAT Signature">
      <t>The signature of the PAT is created as specified by JWS <xref
      target="RFC7515"></xref> Section 5.1 Steps 1 through 6. PAT MUST use the
      JWS Protected Header. For the JWS Payload and the JWS Protected Header,
      the lexicographic ordering and white space rules described in <xref
      target="pat_header"></xref> and <xref target="pat_payload"></xref>, and
      JSON serialization rules in <xref target="json_serialization"></xref> of
      this document MUST be followed.</t>

      <t>The PAT is cryptographically signed by the domain hosting the DNS
      server and optionally by a third party who performed privacy and
      security audit of the DNS server. The privacy policy information will be
      attested using "Organization Validation" (OV) or "Extended Validation"
      (EV) certificates to avoid bad actors taking advantage of this mechanism
      to advertise DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers for illegitimate
      and fraudulent purposes meant to trick DNS clients into believing that
      they are using a legitimate DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS server
      hosted to provide privacy for DNS transactions. Alternatively, the DNS
      client will have to be configured to trust the leaf of the signer of the
      PAT object. That is, trust of the signer MUST NOT be determined by
      validating the signer via the OS or browser trust chain because that
      would allow any arbitrary entity to operate a DNS server and assert any
      sort of privacy policy.</t>

      <t>JWS <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> Section 5.1 Step 7 JWS JSON
      serialization is supported for PAT to enable multiple signatures to be
      applied to the PAT object. For example, the PAT object can be
      cryptographically signed by the domain hosting the DNS server and by a
      third party who performed privacy and security audit of the DNS
      server.</t>

    <section anchor="extending_pat" title="Extending PAT">
      <t>PAT includes the minimum set of claims needed to securely assert the
      privacy policy information of the DNS server. JWT supports a straight
      forward way to add additional asserted or signed information by simply
      adding new claims. PAT can be extended beyond the defined base set of
      claims to represent other DNS server information requiring assertion or
      validation. Specifying new claims follows the baseline JWT procedures
      (<xref target="RFC7519"></xref> Section 10.1). Understanding new claims
      on the DNS client is optional. The creator of a PAT object cannot assume
      that the DNS client will understand the new claims.</t>

      <t>JSON objects can include spaces and line breaks, and key value pairs

      format. In order to make the digital signature verification work
      deterministically, the JSON representation of the JWS Protected Header
      object and JWS Payload object MUST be computed as follows.</t>

      <t>The JSON object MUST follow the following rules. These rules are
      based on the thumbprint of a JSON Web Key (JWK) as defined in Section 3
      Step 1 of <xref target="RFC7638"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The use of PAT object based on the validation of the digital
      signature and the associated certificate requires consideration of the
      authentication and authority or reputation of the signer to attest the
      privacy policy information of the DNS server being asserted. Bad actors
      can host DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and claim the
      servers offer privacy but exactly do the opposite to invade the privacy
      of the user. Bad actor can get a domain name, host DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and get the DNS server certificate signed by a
      CA. The privacy policy information will have to be attested using OV/EV
      certificates or a PAT object signer trusted by the DNS client to prevent
      the attack.</t>

      <t>If the PAT object is asserted by a third party, it can do a "time of
      check" but the DNS server is susceptible of "time of use" attack. For
      example, changes to privacy policy of the DNS server like sharing
      identifiable transaction data with partners can cause a disagreement
      between the PAT object and the DNS server operation. In other words, the
      DNS server might have complied with the privacy policy when it was
      audited (by the 3rd party) but could now be in non-compliance with its
      privacy policy, hence the PAT object needs to be also asserted by the
      domain hosting the DNS server. In addition, the PAT object needs to have
      a short expiration time (e.g., 7 days) to ensure the DNS server's domain
      re-asserts the privacy policy information and limits the damage from
      change in privacy policy and mis-issuance.</t>
